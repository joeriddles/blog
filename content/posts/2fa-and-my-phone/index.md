I love Bitwarden and I love two-factor authentication. Most of my 2FA tokens are stored in Google Authenticator on my iPhone. There's something I **hate** about needing to pull out my phone just to pop open the authenticator app, search for the service, and type it in on my computer.

One solution to this is to use [Bitwarden's 2FA feauture](https://bitwarden.com/help/authenticator-keys/). My main issue with doing this is that it becomes even more "game over" if my Bitwarden account is comprompised -- the would-be attacker now has both factor of authentication: my passwords and tokens. This seems like it somewhat defeats the "two-factor" point of two-factor authentication.

So far I have migrated just a single 2FA token into Bitwarden. I love being able to login without grabbing my phone. I also like the idea of not needing to text a 2FA code to my wife when she logs into a service from our shared Bitwarden organization.

What do you think? Is the convenience of storing 2FA tokens in Bitwarden worth the reduced security posture? Let me know in the comments below!

Upon asking my wife if she had any feedback on this blog post, she said:

> I think it's easier to not have two-factor authentication and use the same password for everything.
