I don't watch a lot of YouTube. I'm subscribed to far more channels than I ever have time to watch, but the channel that I watch most regularly tends to be [Corridor Crew](https://www.youtube.com/@CorridorCrew). The combination of breaking down cool visual special effects, the fun nature of the regular cast, and the relatively short average video length keeps me coming back for more.

This week I watched their latest episode, [Animators React to Bad & Great Cartoons 16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa9hD-W8nn8). I found two lessons from interviewee Aaron Blaise that I wanted to take the time to jot down.

### Good leaders don't keep the fun work for themselves

In [this part of the video](https://youtu.be/wa9hD-W8nn8?feature=shared&t=349), Aaron discusses how his coworker and mentor gave Aaron the opportunity and challenge to work on an interesting and difficult shot of the Beast from Disney's Beauty and the Beast.

> one of the great things about Glenn is just how incredibly generous he is and he gives you work that you just can't you can't handle and but he he works you through it and by the end of it you know I've done this in interviews before you start here and at the end of it you're up here you know and and what's nice is that the way it worked at Disney is when you finished a film the directors on the next film look at your real from your previous film yeah this about as good as a of a real you get yeah it it launch it launched my career and it was all because of Glen.

A coworker of mine shared a TikTok video the other day with a group of mentors that listed "10 signs you have a good boss". One of the signs was that they delegate the interesting and challenging tasks to you.

It's so tempting to dole out the busy work to others and keep the fun, interesting work for ourselves, but as Aaron made clear, it is incredibly valuable and affirming as leader to share interesting work with others instead of hoarding it for ourselves.

### Being the best you can at work requires work outside of work

In [another part of the video](https://youtu.be/wa9hD-W8nn8?feature=shared&t=471), Aaron discusses how he spent time interacting with big cats while animating Rajah in the movie Aladdin. He admits he was struggling as an animator, but was able to use his time spent with the animals to improve his craft.

Some of the [best](https://www.twitch.tv/kitokeboo) [software](https://centsper.com/) engineers I know spend a non-trivial amount of time outside of work hours writing code. Others don't, and that's okay, too! This isn't about hustle culture, but it's unrealistic to expect to reach the same level as someone who is putting in extra time and effort.

### Closing

If you haven't watched Corridor Crew before and have an interest in seeing behind the scenes of VFX or animation, it's worth a watch!

This wasn't the first Animators React episode featuring Aaron Blaise. The [first episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3i7uFeZwCA) with him is also great and features one of my favorite animated movies, Brother Bear. Aaron also has a cool art website with courses: [creatureartteacher.com](https://creatureartteacher.com/).

This is day two of blogging on my [new site]({{< relref "hello" >}})! I hope to keep the streak going tomorrow.
