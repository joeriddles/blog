## Hello

For the last year and a half, I've used [josephriddle.com](https://josephriddle.com) as a playground where I've:
- Tracked bookmarks in the forms of "pins"
- Tracked the books I've read
- Followed my favorite RSS feeds
- Practiced memorizing some of my favorite Bible verses

The one thing I haven't actually used it for is writing blog posts. I created my own blog app using Django and some front end WYSIWYG tooling, but I never really used it for posts. I mostly just used it as a way to take notes from any device. Recently, I started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for note taking instead. I love it so much that I pay $8 per month for their sync feature.

My goal with this site is to minimize the development happening and maximize the writing. I've ported my old website over to [app.josephriddle.com](https://app.josephriddle.com), sans the blog feature.

The source for this blog lives on GitHub, at [`joeriddles/blog`](https://github.com/joeriddles/blog). Since, I've found Obsidian the best way to write my thoughts, I plan on setting up a Vault or folder that auto-syncs to the git repo and updates this website automatically.

I've got a few fun ideas for this website. I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), mostly because I used Go for a work project and enjoyed it a lot. If I do end up customizing some of this site, it would be a nice excuse to do more with Go. Maybe I'll even do a presentation on it for the [Spokane Go User Group](https://www.meetup.com/spokane-go-users-group/).

Above all, I want to practice writing frequently and minimize the friction to doing so.

Cheers,
Joe
