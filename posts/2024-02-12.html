    <h1>Meshtastic & NATS.io</h1>
    <p>
      Yesterday I attended a local developer user group meetup. The topic was <a href="https://meshtastic.org/">Meshtastic</a>, a self-described <q cite="https://meshtastic.org/">open source, off-grid, decentralized, mesh network built to run on affordable, low-power devices.</q> It uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa">LoRa</a> under the hood.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="meshtastic-overview">Meshtastic Overview</h2>
    <p>
      I have never used or heard of Meshtastic or LoRa before. Some interesting bits that stuck stuck out to me:
      <ul>
        <li>Long range: ~1–<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/meshtastic/comments/1fnduwo/mountain_to_mountain_331_km/">205</a> miles</li>
        <li>Slow: ~1–10 kbps</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/meshtastic">Open Source</a></li>
        <li>It supports <b>MQTT</b></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use Meshtastic to send group or direct messages. It uses a mesh network (hence the name), meaning that each device will propogate any message it receives, to a certain point. Messages are sent with an integer that is decremented each time it is forwarded. When the integer reaches zero, it is no longer forwarded.
    </p>

    <p>
      The presenter gave away a device, of which I was the lucky recipient (thanks Jim)! The device was a <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/hardware/devices/heltec-automation/lora32/?heltec=Wireless+Stick+Lite+V3">Heltec LoRa 32 Wireless Stick Lite V3</a>. It is an ESP32 device with no screen. It was already configured with Meshtastic firmware. Here is a <a href="https://docs.heltec.org/en/node/esp32/wireless_stick_lite/index.html#">link</a> to the Heltec docs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first step was to connect the Meshtastic device to my computer. I connected it to my Windows desktop. I would have used my MacBook, but I thought that there were only drivers for Windows. It turns out there are macOS drivers, so I will try that later. Specifically, I needed the <a href="https://www.silabs.com/developer-tools/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads">CP210x USB to UART Bridge</a> drivers. I don't know what CP10x or UART is. Before connecting the device, I downloaded the zip file and unzipped it. Inside there is a file with instructions and release notes. On my machine it was named <code>CP210x_Universal_Windows_Driver_ReleaseNotes.txt</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the driver ready, I connected the device and ... nothing. Turns out I was using a <i>charging</i> USB-C cable, not a <i>data</i> USB-C cable. I don't know how to tell the difference just by looking at them or if there even is a difference on the outside. Regardless, I found another cable that I knew could send data and tried again. This time Windows recognized the device and prompted me to install drivers. I pointed Windows to the previously unzipped folder and voilà. I verified the device was showing up in <code>Device Manager > Ports</code>.
    </p>
    <aside>
      I wasn't able to figure out how to make the device show up in WSL2. There are Linux drivers available, but I didn't spend too much time trying to figure that part out.
    </aside>
    <p>
      From there, I connected to the device using the Meshtastic web client: <a href="https://client.meshtastic.org/">https://client.meshtastic.org/</a>. You'll need to use a Chrome-based browser.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="nats-mqtt">MQTT with NATS.io</h2>
    <p>
      I mentioned above that Meshtastic supports speaking to an MQTT server. This got me thinking immediately about using <a href="https://nats.io/">NATS</a>, which can <a href="https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/mqtt">act as an MQTT server</a>. A sample NATS server configuration to enable MQTT looks like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code># nats.conf
jetstream: {}
mqtt: {
    listen: "0.0.0.0:1883"
}</code></pre>
    <aside>
      Note that you must have JetStream enabled, as mentioned in the <a href="https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/mqtt#jetstream-requirements">NATS MQTT docs</a>.
    </aside>
    <p>
      I started the NATS server on my Windows desktop. Note that I used <code>0.0.0.0</code> to the server is accessible outside of my localhost. <code>1833</code> is the default MQTT port.
    </p>

    <h2>Meshtastic → NATS.io</h2>
    <p>
      Back in the Meshtatic web client, I configured a few things. First, I connected the device to my local WiFi so it could talk to my NATS server. Then I enabled serial output (I'm not sure if this was totally necessary). Finally, I configured MQTT with the IP address of my Windows machine and the NATS server's MQTT port and a username. It doesn't matter what the username value is in this case, but it does seem to be required by MQTT.

    <p>
      Finally, I ran <code>nats sub '>'</code> on my Windows machine to watch all traffic from the NATS server. Then I sent a message in the Meshtastic web client in one of the channels:
    </p>

    <aside>
      Meshtastic uses <a href="https://buf.build/meshtastic/protobufs/docs/main:meshtastic#meshtastic.ServiceEnvelope">protobufs</a> and headers, thus the characters before and after the message
    </aside>

    <h2 id="whats-next">What's next?</h2>
    <p>
      Next I'd like to try the inverse of what I did: sending a NATS message that shows up in Meshtastic. That will require correctly encoding a protobuf, but I don't imagine that≠i will be too complicated.
