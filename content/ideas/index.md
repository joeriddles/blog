Inspired by [this post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39511714) about idea pages on the orange site™️, I've added an ideas page to my website. The following are various ideas I've had in no particular order:

### Blog posts
- [x] Add an ideas page to website
- [ ] Favorite coffee shops
- [ ] Transcribe lessons learned car presentation

### Code projects
- [ ] Obsidian plugin for Hugo
