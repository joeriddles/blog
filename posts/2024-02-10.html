    <h1>TIL — SQLite <code>UPSERT</code> with <code>extends</code></h1>
  
    <p>
      Today I was trying setting up a personal project that uses <a href="https://sqlc.dev/">sqlc</a>, a Go tool that generates code based off defined SQL queries. It's <i>not</i> an ORM, but looks and feels kind of like one. Generally I prefer using ORMs, but none of Go's feel great. After some conversations, I wanted to give sqlc a shot.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Setting up sqlc is straight forward. You define a SQL schema, SQL queries, and a config file. I set it up using SQLite. This worked fine, until I wrote an <code>UPSERT</code> query.
    </p>
  
  <pre><code>-- name: SavePin :one
INSERT INTO pins (
  title, url, image_url, created_at
) VALUES (
  ?, ?, ?, ?
)
ON CONFLICT (url)
DO UPDATE SET title = ?, image_url = ?
RETURNING *;</code></pre>
  
    <p>
      sqlc happily generated Go code for this query, but at runtime the query failed: <code>query_test.go:43: missing argument with index 5</code>.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      I also tried using named params, but to no avail. I created an <a href="https://github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc/issues/3834">issue</a> in the GitHub repo for sqlc and dove into the source code to try to figure our what was going on.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The root cause of the bug is that the SQL query expects six params, but only four were getting passed in the generated code:
    </p>
  
<pre><code>func (q *Queries) SavePin(ctx context.Context, arg SavePinParams) (Pin, error) {
  row := q.db.QueryRowContext(ctx, savePin,
    arg.Title,
    arg.Url,
    arg.ImageUrl,
    arg.CreatedAt,
  )
  var i Pin
  err := row.Scan(
    &i.ID,
    &i.Title,
    &i.Url,
    &i.ImageUrl,
    &i.CreatedAt,
  )
  return i, err
}</code></pre>
  
  <p>
    Manually updating the code to pass <code>QueryRowContext</code> the params <code>arg.Title</code> and <code>arg.ImageUrl</code> fixed the runtime error. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I forked the repo and <a href="https://github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc/compare/main...joeriddles:sqlc:joeriddles/3834">wrote a simple, failing test</a> to help demonstrate the error I saw. Taking a second look through the issues in the repo and I saw that <a href="https://github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc/issues/3439">other</a> <a href="https://github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc/issues/3508">people</a> had ran into similar issues when using SQLite.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I wrote a simple VS Code <code>launch.json</code> config to debug the code generation:
  </p>
  
<pre><code>{
  "configurations": [
  {
    "name": "debug",
    "type": "go",
    "request": "launch",
    "mode": "debug",
    "program": "${workspaceFolder}/cmd/sqlc/main.go",
    "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/examples/booktest",
    "args": ["generate"]
  }
  ]
}</code></pre>
  
  <p>I also needed to configure VS Code to add <code>"go.buildTags": "examples"</code> to <code>.vscode/settings.json</code> because all the examples use that build tag.</p>
  
  <p>
    After stepping line-by-line through the <code>internal/codegen/golang</code> package, I realized the error was further upstream, so I set my breakpoints earlier and stepped through the <code>internal/compiler</code> package. Eventually, I reached this line:
  </p>
  
  <img src="/public/2024-02-10-debug.png" alt="Screenshot of VS Code breakpoint on" style="max-height: 400px;" />
  
  <p>
    It appears that the anaylzer isn't even parsing the <code>RETURNING</code> code, nor the <code>DO UPDATE SET</code> line. I dug into the SQLite docs to get a better understanding of how the <code>UPSERT</code> works. Reading the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_upsert.html#:~:text=upsert%20is%20not%20standard%20sql."><i>first line</i></a> yields the following:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    UPSERT is not standard SQL.
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    So, it seems that sqlc simply does not currently support parsing the custom <code>UPSERT</code> syntax of SQLite. Fortuantely, there is a solution. <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_upsert.html#:~:text=to%20use%20the%20value%20that%20would%20have%20been%20inserted%20had%20the%20constraint%20not%20failed%2C%20add%20the%20special%20%22excluded.%22%20table%20qualifier%20to%20the%20column%20name.%20">A few lines down</a> is the following:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    To use the value that would have been inserted had the constraint not failed, add the special "excluded." table qualifier to the column name.
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>So I updated my query to the following and everything worked:</p>
  
<pre><code>-- name: SavePin :one
INSERT INTO pins (
  title, url, image_url, created_at
) VALUES (
  ?, ?, ?, ?
)
ON CONFLICT (url)
DO UPDATE SET title = excluded.title, image_url = excluded.image_url
RETURNING *;</code></pre>
  
  <p>
    What's the lesson? <s>What is the takeaway? Don't mess with Maui when he's on the breakaway.</s> Read the docs.
