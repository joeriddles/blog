Unclear expectations can be awesome. They can feel liberating for a while, like the world is your oyster and you can take on any and all challenges!

They can also be draining. When others have unclear expectations for you, you're left floating in the NZM (Nebulous Zone of Mystery:tm:). The NZM is a terrible place to be long term. When in it, you question your every decision.

- Am I spending too long on this? Not enough time?
- Am I doing this right? Is it important?
- Am I wasting their time on this?
- Is this what they want me to be doing?
- Am I going to be in trouble for doing this?

How do you get out of the NZM? Your leader needs to set clear expectations. John C. Maxwell says it well in this quote from the [following video](https://youtu.be/1Jcy3L0DSm8) (emphasis added):

> The longer you withhold expectations of people that you know they need to know and meet the harder is for those expectations to become a reality in their life. In other words, the longer you wait the worse it becomes. **So I learned on the front end as a leader and as a friend lay out all of the issues at the beginning**. Then you can build on those and develop a good relationship and no one ever has to feel like you manipulated or blindsided them.

From another of one of his videos in the same series:

> If we we don't have upfront expectations we're bound to cause disappointment to the people that we work with. That's the absolute fact.

Expectations go hand-in-hand with constraints and constraints enable creativity, not diminish it. Imagine being asked to build a custom drawing app but given no clear constraints on the required features nor budget. You could spend hours upon hours creating the highest quality app for creating vector art, but come to find, the client just wanted to be able to drop shapes on a page. This would leave you both frustrated â€” you frustrated that you've wasted your time and likely won't be paid for the features that weren't asked for and the client frustrated that their implicit expectations were unmet.

tl;dr explicit expectations are better than implicit ones (and we all have implicit ones).

```

Explicit is better than implicit.
